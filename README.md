# Cubit_Stylization

> Yifan Ren, Yang Heng

You should run the code in Linux.

To run the code, simply get into the cubicStylization_ImGui and create a folder called "build". Get into build, open the terminal and type "cmake .." and enter.
After that you type "make" and enter. When this finished there should be a excutable file called "cubicStylization_bin".

You can test the code with "./cubicStylization_bin name.obj" where name is up to your choice and you can choose any of .obj file in the meshes folder.
